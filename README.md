# Extracting-dominant-wave-characteristics-using-Proper-Orthogonal-Decomposition

Sample code used to extract dominant wave properties (wavelength, wave direction, wave period) using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Videos of the ocean surface are captured from an unmanned aerial system in and around Galveston Bay, TX. More details can be found in the paper:
